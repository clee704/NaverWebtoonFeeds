Naver Webtoon Feeds
===================

Feeds for Naver webtoons (webcomics). Inspired by NaverComicFeed_.
Unlike NaverComicFeed, it embeds links in feeds, instead of actual comic
images.

You can use the deployed app at http://naverwebtoonfeeds.clee.kr/, or
run your own app if you like. As an example, see nwf-heroku_ for information
about deploying to Heroku.
